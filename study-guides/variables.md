# Variables
## Variables

In order to save the DOM references to your HTML elements, you must store them in variables.

Let's breakdown the syntax to **declare a variable** in JavaScript.

```javascript
var varName = value;
```

- `var`: This keyword defines a variable. There are three types of variables that were introduced with the [ES6 JavaScript revision](http://es6-features.org/#Constants). To declare a variable, developers may now define a variable as `var`, `const`, and `let`. We will explain in more detail below the difference between these variable types.
- `varName`: Name of your variable.
- `=`: Similar to most programming languages, the `=` symbol is used to define and set a variable name to a specific value.
- `;`: All JavaScript lines of code and statements must end with a semicolon `;`.

To define an empty variable, just define the type of variable and name, and end with a semicolon (e.g `var varName`).


#### `var`, `let`, and `const`

In some programming languages, like Java and C++, when declaring a variable you must specify the data type (integer, String, float, boolean, etc.) In JavaScript, a variable does not need to be specifically defined in its declaration. Instead, the keyword `var`, `const`, and `let` define how a variable can be used and/or changed.


- `var`: Variables defined by a `var` declaration are typically declared *outside* of a function and act as global variables. They can be accessed by any function, redefined, and their value may change at any point in the program flow.
- `let`: Variables defined by `let` declaration are typically defined *inside* of a block of code (typically defined by curly brackets, `{}`). This block of code is sometimes called **scope**. Within its scope, a `let` variable's value may change but cannot be redefined. This ensures that a `let` variable name must be unique within a single scope. `let` variables are typically used within functions for temporarily used and are not called in multiple functions like `var` variables.
- `const`: Variables defined by `const` declaration are **constant** values. They cannot be updated or re-declared.

When storing DOM variables, take a moment to think about which type of variable you would use to store DOM references to HTML elements.


- Since there are no attributes attached to this element, no `id` or `class` name, this eliminates the use of the `getElementById` method.
- We can only use the `querySelector` or `querySelectorAll` method. However, since there is only a single instance of a `p` element, we will elect to use the `querySelector` method with the **element selector** associated with its tag name `p`.

```javascript
const pElem = document.querySelector('p');
```

Notice that we use either **single or double quotation marks** as a parameter to the `querySelector` method.
