# CSS Basics

In a document, or a website, each element is represented by a regular box. Each of the rectangular boxes has four edges: the margin edge, border edge, padding edge, and content edge. Let's take a look at the CSS Box Model.

- `{}`: In CSS we use the curly brackets `{}` to define a rule set. All rules or declarations must be included inside the brackets.
- Selector: A selector is used to identify the element the CSS rule will be applied to. In the example above, we use an element selector to apply rules to the entire body element. Basic selectors can select all elements, elements by type, class, and id, or by attribute.
- Declaration: Each property and value pair is considered a declaration or rule.
