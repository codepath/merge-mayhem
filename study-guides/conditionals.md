# Conditionals
```javascript
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}
```
1. The keyword `if` followed by some parentheses.
2. A condition to test, placed inside the parentheses (typically "is this value bigger than this other value?", or "does this value exist?"). The condition makes use of the [comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math#comparison_operators) we discussed in the last module and returns `true` or `false`.
3. A set of curly braces, inside which we have some code â€” this can be any code we like, and it only runs if the condition returns `true`.
